# graft_staking_rpc
Wallet Announcements sent to Telegram Bot and Telegram actions sent back to the SuperNode

The purpose of this is to monitor your Grat wallet(s) and create hooks (via RPC) which will be broadcast to a Telegram Bot. You will then be able to msg the bot to restake, sweep and generally monitor your staking wallets without needing to log into your supernode via Terminal.

# graft_staking_rpc
Wallet Announcements sent to Telegram Bot and Telegram actions sent back to the SuperNode

The purpose of this project is to create a means of monitoring your Graft wallet(s) by creating hooks (via RPC) which will be broadcast to a Telegram Bot.

The intention is to get read-only and event-based updates broadcast to the bot, followed by actions that can be run inside Telegram to semi-automate the necessary processes on your SuperNode.
